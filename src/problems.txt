things to address that were discovered in testing:
we still get a "No such room" message when loading a new game.

sitOn.... do we want to change it?
on death, inventory should be removed and dropped in room. (Drei)
transform event (with white dragon) does not transform or remove the egg.

Still working on the teleport event. It is now causing 2 issues:
1- it doesn't actually move you
2- it says you can't throw an item when you can actually throw it
	example: dragonglass
