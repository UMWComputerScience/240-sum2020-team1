things to address that were discovered in testing:
eat: pizza
	- returns a NullPointerException.
	* need to check the ItemSpeccificCommand class. I added a 'eat' option to the pizza in the zork file and it works fine now. If the ItemSpeccificCommand is passed a verb that the item doesn't have, it should respond with something like "You can [verb] to [item]."

	- also, the eat command not appear to remove the item form inventory.
	[question] should items with the 'eat' verb be removed from inventory when they are eaten?

score command:
	- at present there does not appear to be any accumulation of points for score. 


take all command:
	- return an IndexOutOfBoundsException: Source does not fit the dest.

events:
	win - should end the game with a "You win!" style message.
	die - sets the players health to 0, ends the game. displays a "You have died" Message.
