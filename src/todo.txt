	NonPlayerCharacters:
		1- do they show up in the room when you enter/use look command?
		Example:
			Rotunda
			You are in a beutiful round entry chamber, with tall white pillars that seemingly reach to
			the skies. There is an elevator here.
			
			There is a pizza here.
			There is a microwaveBurrito here.
			There is a zaku here.
			
			There is an Old-Man here.
			
		2- can you talk to them and have a pre-programmed response?
		Example:
			>Talk Old-Man
			Yes the Old-Man can be communicated with.

		Explination:
			the "Old Man" is the name of the NPC in question.
			the "Yes the Old Man can be communicated with." is a simple print statement used to verify 
			that the "Talk to" command is returning a response. It is NOT a response drawn from the NPC's 			     messages HashTable.
		3- Can the NPC return a response from their messages hashtable?
			Each NPC has a HashTable with a topic<string> has the key, and a response<string> as the
			value. 
			example:
			+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
			| KEY(topic)<string>| VALUE(response)<string>                                             |

			If you use the "talk" command, and do not indicate a topic, the NPC should respond with
			the "default" value.

			Example:
			>talk Old-Man
			The Old-man responds: "Yes, I am the old man. I've been around and seen a thing or two you
                        young wipper snapper. I've been across the crystal mountains, and seen the burning sands.
                        Even made some good trade deals."
		
			you can also talk to an NPC about a given topic by appending "about" followed by a topic to
			the talk command with the topic being surrounds by double quotes, or single quotes.
			Example:
			>talk Old-man about 'fire scorpions'
			The Old-man responds: "Horrible devil spawn those things. Individually they are a dangerous 
                        annoyance, but you'll never encounter a single fire scorpion. They always congregate in
                        hoards of hundreds. Their stingers can pierce thin armor and their venom make you feel like 
                        you're on fire and while you're screaming and flailing in response to feeling your skin burn
                        off, the gods cursed critters are crawling all over you cutting into your body, taking out 
                        hunks! If we could eliminate all of those creepy bars it would be godly work to do so!"

			If you supply a topic that is not a key in the NPCs hashtable, the response will be the 
			'nonknown' value.
			Example:
			>talk Old-man about "Sea scorpions"
			The Old-man responds: "Huh? what? I don't know anything about that."


			
		the "talk to" command will return the response
